Why do you care so much about this rating system? It distorts people's efforts. Do you even understand the concepts of alienation and concretization? Let me give you an example: suppose your family has four members. Your mom cooks every day, and your dad goes out to earn money. At the end of the month, the system calculates the scores and declares, "My dad got MVP!" Meanwhile, your mom, who washes clothes and cooks every day, is labeled as a "freeloader" with a score of 3.0. Your dad earns a lot of money, so he gets a 13.0 rating and is considered the one carrying the team. Does that make sense? Why do you care so much about this rating? Shouldn't it be about what you actually did?
